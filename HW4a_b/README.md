My personal special tile:
As of now, with icon and idea implemented, my tile (SwitchTile implements SpecialTile) will allow the player who activates this tile to pick a tile in their rack to switch blindly with another player, assuming whatever tile they are giving away is worse than what they may possibly get. Special Tile idea subject to change.
